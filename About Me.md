# About Me

Today, you will be creating an *About Me* page using HTML, where you can tell the world (or maybe just your friends, or perhaps just a page for you to look back at years later) about yourself.

There is literally no requirements as to how you design this site or what content needs to be on there. This, like all you've done so far, is also a work-in-progress, so you can add more information to it as time goes on and you have more stories to tell.

## HTML lists

Something that might be useful when creating this webpage - and many others, is lists.

In HTML, there are two main types of lists: **unordered** and **ordered** lists.

### Unordered lists

Unordered lists is used to list some items, usually in bullet points. Here's an example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Math</li>
  <li>Science</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>History</li>
</ul>
```

`ul` stands for unordered-list and `li` stands for list-item.

When displayed, the list above will show up as:

<ul>
  <li>Math</li>
  <li>Science</li>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>History</li>
</ul>

### Ordered lists

Sometimes, just sometimes, order is good. When we want a list with order, we use an ordered list.

The syntax difference between unordered and ordered lists is that:

* Unordered lists use the `ul` tag
* Ordered lists use the `ol` tag (guess what the `ol` stands for ðŸ¤”)

An example of an ordered list is below.

```html
<ol>
  <li>Breakfast</li>
  <li>Lunch</li>
  <li>Dinner</li>
</ol>
```

<ol>
  <li>Breakfast</li>
  <li>Lunch</li>
  <li>Dinner</li>
</ol>

Think about how you can use these to tell your story in your *About Me* page.
